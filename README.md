# 📊 Tableau Dashboard Project (2024)

## 🔍 Overview
This project presents a Tableau dashboard developed in 2024 to analyze
business and event-level data using multiple Excel data sources.

The dashboard was created after performing data cleaning and preprocessing
using Python scripts. Due to Tableau license constraints, the original
interactive workbook is no longer accessible. However, the complete
dashboard output has been preserved and documented in PDF format for review.

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Prior to visualization, raw data from multiple Excel files was processed
using Python scripts to:
- Handle missing and inconsistent values
- Standardize column names and data formats
- Merge datasets from multiple sources
- Generate analysis-ready tables for Tableau

## 📈 Key Insights
- Identified key trends across multiple business dimensions
- Compared performance across categories and time periods
- Used filters and calculated fields for deeper analytical insights

## 🧠 Notes
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, including
Python-based data preprocessing, dashboard development, and data
storytelling using Tableau.

Due to tooling and access limitations, this repository focuses on final
dashboard outputs and analytical insights rather than the original
Tableau workbook files.
